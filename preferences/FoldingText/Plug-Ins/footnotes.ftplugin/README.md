# Footnotes: FoldingText Plugin

By [Jamie Kowalski](https://github.com/jamiekowalski)

Inserts footnote reference and definition using a random identifier. Keyboard command `Shift-Command-F` presents pop-up window for footnote text entry; reference is then inserted at cursor position, and footnote text is inserted at the end of the document.

## Planned Features

- Hover over a footnote reference for a pop-up of the footnote text.
- Click the footnote reference to jump to the footnote definition. Click the definition reference to jump back.
