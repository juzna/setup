# Filter: FoldingText Extension

Filters a FoldingText document based on an expression given in a simple syntax. For example, the expression `;writ/fiction/@todo` will show only items tagged @todo that are under an item containing the text 'fiction' that is under an heading with the text 'writ' (including partial word matches, so ‘writing’ would be matched).

The extension can also be triggered with the keyboard shortcut Shift+Command+' (i.e. quote key). Tthis can be changed near the end of the main.js file.

If the path cannot be parsed, a message is logged to the console. (Access the console in FoldingText choosing Help > SDK Runner and clicking the gear icon in the window that opens.)

## To Install

Download the [ZIP of this repository](https://github.com/jamiekowalski/foldingtext-extra/archive/master.zip) and move `filter.ftplugin` and `jmk_panel.ftplugin` to your FoldingText plug-ins folder (open this from FoldingText by choosing File > Open Application Folder). Restart FoldingText.

Important: this plugin requires `jmk_panel.ftplugin`.

Variables at the top of the `main.js` file can be customized, e.g. set `filterOnTextChange` to `false` to only change node path upon closing the panel. Modifying the syntax characters is possible, but may cause bugs.

## Examples of expressions:

- `@important` : items tagged @important . Note that tag matches must be exact; `@im` will not match an item tagged `@important`. This is in contrast to text matches.

- `not @done` : items not tagged @done . Note that if an item is tagged @done but has subitems, it will not be hidden unless the ‘don’t show ancestors’ option (`|` at start or end of query) is used.

- `;misc` : headings that contain the text 'misc'

- `;misc items` : headings that contain both 'misc' and 'items'

- `;misc or items` : headings that contain either 'misc' or 'items'

- `misc/today tomorrow` : items that contain both 'today' and 'tomorrow under an item that contains 'misc'.

- `;code;fold text` : heading that contains both 'fold' and 'text' under a heading that contains 'code'.

- `yesterday today and tomorrow` : items that contains 'yesterday' and 'today' and 'tomorrow'. When only one boolean operator is used with three or more terms, this operator is used as the default.

- `yesterday or today and tomorrow` : items that contains 'yesterday' and 'today' and 'tomorrow'. When a mix of 'and' and 'or' is used, 'or's are changed to 'and'. (Grouping terms with parentheses is not currently supported. If you need that functionality, use the full node path syntax; see below.)

- any expression ending with `/` : show descendants (descendants are always shown if the last segment in the expression is a heading)

- `#cm` : items that contain a Critic Markup comment/annotation

- `#hl` : items that contain a Critic Markup highlight

- `#dl` or `#del` : items that contain a Critic Markup deletion

- `#in` or `#ins` : items that contain a Critic Markup insertion

- `#em` or `#emph` : items that contain a Markdown `em` element

- `#st` or `#str` or `#strong` : items that contain a Markdown `strong` element

- `#job` : items that have the property “job”. Properties should be added at the end of a path segment. With the following example text, this query with show “John”. Add `/` to the query to also reveal the line `job : developer`.

        John
            job : developer

- `#job~dev` : items that have the property “job” with a value containing “dev”. When using a comparison operator (e.g. `~` – see next item for more), the `#` prefix is unnecessary.

- `age>30`, `age<20`, `age>=25` : items that have the property “age” with values < 30, etc.

- `[start:end]` : slice of the results, 0-indexed. `[0:3]` show the first four; `[2:]` show the third and following; `[2:-1]` show the third through the second-to-last.

- any expression starting or ending with `|` : don't show ancestors

- any expression starting with `/` or `(/` : use FoldingText's full XPath syntax instead of the modified syntax described here. See documentation on the [FoldingText website](http://www.foldingtext.com/sdk/nodepaths/).

## Change log

- 0.4.1
	- Partial workaround for cursor position bug in Mountain Lion (in jmk_panel).
	- Experimental feature: start query with `+`, `*`, or `-` for union, intersect, except operation (respectively) with current view. For performance reasons, cannot chain. No ancestors option has been changed to `|`.
- 0.4
	- Added tag drop-down menu when ‘@’ is entered.
	- Added `jmk filter tag` command to bring up filter panel with ‘@’ entered.
- 0.3
	- jmkpanel.js now uses a constructor function and is more configurable, for ease of using it in other plugins. See the file header for details.
- 0.2
	- Dismissing the panel with `Escape` returns document view and selection to state before opening panel; this makes it easy to quickly view different queries, then return directly back to where you were. Press `Return` or click within the document to dismiss the pane and keep the newly queried view.
- 0.1
	- Initial release.

## Known Issues

- If the extension is triggered, and without releasing the Command key, Command+A or Command+Z is pressed, these commands act on the editor.
- Syntax characters – i.e. space, `;`, `#`, `/`, etc. – will always be recognized by such, even if wrapped in quotes.
- Cannot undo changes to text in the panel.

## Planned Features

- Add syntax for querying tag values, i.e `@tag=value`, etc.
- Allow grouping terms with parentheses.
- Save named queries.
